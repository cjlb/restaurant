# restaurant
 This C++ project consists of three programs. The first is a restaurant program, designed to allow staff to input                                      and manage customer orders. The second is meant for use to modify the menu used for the first system and the final is meant for use by restaurant                                     management to monitor sales. The programs use a very simple text based storage system and are all all feature console based user interfaces.
